Based on an an idea and script by Mike Gogins, this Python script creates an
MP4 video from a WAV file, with the video consisting of a static spectrogram
of the contents of the WAV file. The intended use of this script is to render
a piece of music into a form that can be uploaded to YouTube.

This program has ben tested only on Linux. You must have both sox and ffmpeg
installed and on the path.

    usage: yt-render.py [-h] [-m METADATA_FILE] [-r] [-p] [-v]

    Build MP4 video, with static spectrogram, from WAV file.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -m METADATA_FILE  Pathname of metadata file
      -r                Draw spectrograph without axes/legends
      -p                Print a blank metadata form to the screen and exit
      -v                show program's version number and exit

The script will create two new files:

* a spectrogram png (generated by sox)
* an MP4 video (generated by ffmpeg, and which incorporates both the sound file and the spetrogram

The metadata file uses standard config file format and consistes of a set of
key/value pairs and a "section" header. For example:

    [__track__]
    soundfile=hexany_catalog_part1_master.wav
    album=Hexany Permutations
    title=Part 1
    year=2016
    track=1
    artist=Dave Seidel
    composer=Dave Seidel
    genre=Electroacoustic
    publisher=Mysterybear Music, ASCAP

* The "\[\_\_track\_\_\]" header is mandatory, as are all the other fields.
* The "soundfile" value must be the name (with full path, if not in your current working directory).
* All of the other values are typical metadata fields.
